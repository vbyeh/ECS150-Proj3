	Once again, we used the online C++ documentation at www.cplusplus.com as a reference for how to create and access STL objects. We used references for the list and vector data types, provided again below:

	We kept up-to-date with questions and answers on Piazza, and discussed the project with other students in the Kemper computer lab, providing help when we could. We did not share or copy code from any other students, so any similarities between our code and other students code are purely coincidental.
	
	Our code for Project 3 relies heavily on our code for Project 2. Specifically, we use the same ThreadStore class as an interface for our threading and scheduling functions, as well as a new class called MemoryPool that interfaces with ThreadStore in a way similar to our Mutex and Thread Control Block classes.
